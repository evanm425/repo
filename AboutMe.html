	<strong>About Me</strong><br>
	I am a 15 year old that is trying coding for the first time!
	This is an experimental website to test my coding capabilities. I just started learning to code and I have a vague understanding of html. I am painfully watching tutorials on YouTube on how I can code a website. I don't know CSS yet so my site isn't that good. All progress of this site is going onto Github. Here is my <a href="https://www.github.com/evanm425">Github.</a><br>
